## API

### **Class Inbox**

### new Inbox(username: string)

Creates a new inbox for the given username

### emailHeaders: EmailInfo[]

Array with the headers of all the emails in the inbox. These are
not the full email, only metadata. You need to call **getEmail()**
to load the body and any additional data.

### .refresh()

**ASYNC**  
Obligatory to call before trying to access emails, as this
loads the initial email headers. You can call this anytime
to refresh the inbox with new emails.

### .getEmail(id: string): Email

**ASYNC**  
Retrieves the whole email with the given id. Use the id from
**emailHeaders**.

### .getEmailsFrom(address: string): EmailHeader[]

Return a list of all the email headers from the specified address.
Does not refresh the emails.

### .waitForEmailsFrom(address: string | RegExp, timeout: number): Promise<EmailHeader[]>

**ASYNC**  
Poll for new emails from the given address, can be a regex.
Waits until timeout runs out.
Stops after the first encounter of a new mail.
Returns a list of email headers because there may be 
multiple new emails, or **null** if timed out.

### **EmailHeader**

```typescript
interface EmailHeader {
	id: string;
	subject: string;
	//Email address that sent the email johnnydoe@gmail.com
	fromEmail: string;
	//Johhny Doe
	fromName: string;
	//Epoch time when email was received

	//Raw email heaeder as received from mailinator
	mailinatorHeader: MailinatorEmailHeader;
}
```


### **Email**

	//Email address that sent the email johhnydoe@gmail.com
	fromEmail: string;
